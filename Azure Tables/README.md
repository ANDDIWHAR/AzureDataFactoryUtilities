### Overview

The Azure Tables folder contains the Data Definition Language (DDL) used to configure database control tables at the Table and Field levels within a reference relational database independent of the source and target data platforms. Datatype and sensitivity-related metadata fields are included in the Field table, and can be used for adjusting the scope of extraction by an Azure Data Factory pipeline.
